1. [Singly_List]
implement a singly linked list data structure in Python. create basic operations and list manipulation functions, gaining a deeper understanding of linked data structures and their operations.

2.  [Circular_List]
This Python program implements a Circular Linked List using a Node class and a CircularLinkedList class. Each node stores data and a link to the next node, with the last node pointing back to the head to form a circle. The program allows inserting nodes at the beginning or end, deleting a specific node, and displaying the list. When displayed, the elements are shown in order followed by “(back to start)” to indicate the circular structure.

3.  [Doubly_List]
This Python program implements a Doubly Linked List using a Node class and a DoublyLinkedList class. Each node stores data along with pointers to both the previous and next nodes, allowing traversal in both directions. The program supports inserting and deleting nodes at the front and end of the list. It can also display the elements from head to tail or in reverse from tail to head. This makes the doubly linked list more flexible and efficient for bidirectional data navigation compared to a singly linked list.

4.  [Stack]
This Python program implements a Stack data structure using a list. The Stack class provides methods to check if the stack is empty, add elements using push(), remove the top element using pop(), view the top element with peek(), and get the total number of elements using size(). It follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last item added is the first one removed.

5. [Queue]
This Python program implements a Queue using the deque class from the collections module. The Queue class provides methods to check if the queue is empty, add elements to the rear using enqueue(), remove elements from the front using dequeue(), view the first element with front(), and check the total number of elements with size(). It follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, meaning the first item added is the first one removed

6. [DeQueue]
This Python program implements a Deque (Double-Ended Queue) using the deque class from the collections module. The Deque class allows insertion and deletion of elements from both ends — the front and the rear. It includes methods like insert_front(), insert_rear(), delete_front(), delete_rear(), get_front(), get_rear(), and size(). This makes the deque flexible, as it can function as both a queue (FIFO) and a stack (LIFO) depending on how the operations are used.
