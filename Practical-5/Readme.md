1. [Binary_Search]
This program implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) with functionality to insert nodes while maintaining the BST property and to traverse the tree in-order to retrieve elements in sorted order. Each node stores data along with references to its left and right children.

2. [Graph]
This program implements a Graph using an adjacency list with Python’s defaultdict. It provides functionality to add edges between vertices and to traverse the graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). BFS explores all neighbors level by level using a queue, while DFS explores as far as possible along each branch using recursion. This allows the program to visit and display all reachable vertices from a given starting point.

3. [Hash_Table]
This program implements a Hash Table using chaining to handle collisions. Each key-value pair is stored in a list at an index determined by a hash function. The HashTable class provides methods to insert, retrieve, and remove elements by key, as well as a __str__ method to display the table. This allows efficient access, update, and deletion of data based on unique keys.
